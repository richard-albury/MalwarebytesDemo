# UI Exercise:
Create a rich user interface based on the user stories below.

The interface, when complete, will allow a user to start a “Scan” of their system, view its progress, and see some kind of results once it’s complete (all fake).

The scope of this implementation should be limited to displaying visual information and allowing users to navigate through the application.

Each candidate is free to implement the solution in any way they see fit and with any technology they wish to use.

If you want to include visuals for a light saber, thunderbolts, ninjas, or a ham hock – there’s certainly no reason not to (in fact, creative solutions are encouraged).

The primary purpose of this exercise is to both evaluate the code written to implement the exercise, and the process used to get there, so be ready to defend both.

## Visual Examples:
If a candidate wishes for a comparable example of the behavior described in these user stories, they should able to run any modern malware/anti-virus scan to get an idea what we’re looking for (including our own!).

## User Stories:
1. I as a user wish to know what kind of scan my application will perform.
2. I as a user wish to easily start a scan of my system.
3. I as a user wish to be able to monitor the progress of the scan as it completes.
4. I as a user wish to see a list of results from the scan once it’s complete.

# Updated Requirements:
**Use this exercise to show off best practices, like principles, patterns, unit tests, etc.**

Um, okay. There are a couple hundred lines of source code, mostly for the UI, but I'll take a stab at this.

First, principles. Not much code, so DRY hardly applies, but SOLID might be worth a little discussion:
- single responsibility: `ScanDirectory()` and `ScanFile()` each try to do one thing, but they also have to check for cancellation, are coupled to the background worker and the event arguments,
  and eat exceptions. Ugly, but it's a simple demo.
- open/closed: no inheritance or extension here, so not terribly relevant.
- substitution: again, no inheritance in this example, so not terribly relevant.
- interface segregation: if I were doing something where I wanted to provide a way to plug in multiple checks for each file (calculate the checksum, scan the code segment for signatures),
  I might have an interface for the file (abstracting it as a memory buffer, perhaps, with a list of metadata) and then an interface that each check could use (pass in the buffer interface,
  get back a pass/fail with the actual results in the metadata list).
- dependency inversion: in practical terms, all constructors take arguments for their dependencies, which allows for things like mocking. Again, not terribly relevant in this very simple example.

Patterns: the pluggable file checks can be thought of as an example of the visitor pattern. Patterns are a useful way to recognize common scenarios and provide a possible solution,
or at least a way of reasoning about it. In my experience, most developers don't normally think in design patterns, if they even know any beyond singleton and maybe factory and facade.

Unit tests: the code is not set up for testing: all the logic is in the form.

So, let's assume the two functions are moved to a library and the functions are modified to no longer eat exceptions.

You could then write tests against the library which
- verify the function throws if the file/directory doesn't exist
- verify the function throws (ideally with a different exception) if the file/directory is inaccessible because of permissions
- verify the `ScanDirectory()` function returns all the files in a directory (the test setup would create a folder with 0, 1, multiple files, etc. and then delete them in teardown)
- verify the `ScanDirectory()` function recurses into subdirectories
- verify the `ScanFile()` function handles zero-length files
- verify the `ScanFile()` function returns the appropriate result for a suspicious file

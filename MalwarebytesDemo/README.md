# UI Exercise:
Create a rich user interface based on the user stories below.

The interface, when complete, will allow a user to start a “Scan” of their system, view its progress, and see some kind of results once it’s complete (all fake).

The scope of this implementation should be limited to displaying visual information and allowing users to navigate through the application.

Each candidate is free to implement the solution in any way they see fit and with any technology they wish to use.

If you want to include visuals for a light saber, thunderbolts, ninjas, or a ham hock – there’s certainly no reason not to (in fact, creative solutions are encouraged).

The primary purpose of this exercise is to both evaluate the code written to implement the exercise, and the process used to get there, so be ready to defend both.

## Visual Examples:
If a candidate wishes for a comparable example of the behavior described in these user stories, they should able to run any modern malware/anti-virus scan to get an idea what we’re looking for (including our own!).

## User Stories:
1. I as a user wish to know what kind of scan my application will perform.
2. I as a user wish to easily start a scan of my system.
3. I as a user wish to be able to monitor the progress of the scan as it completes.
4. I as a user wish to see a list of results from the scan once it’s complete.
